Hi there👋! 
Grab a mate 🧉️, tea, or coffee☕, and welcome to my GitHub :octocat: .
Here, I share various projects, programming experiments 🔬, 
and—most importantly—my practice in automation testing 🔎🪲.
📧 Feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn 
so we can share knowledge and learn together✨. 
🌈 It’s my pleasure to help and grow in this field 🌻!
